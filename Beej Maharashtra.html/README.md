## 🔧 Key Features Implementation

### AI Fertilizer Recommendation System
```javascript
// Smart fertilizer recommendations based on crop type
async function getFertilizerRecommendation(cropType) {
    const recommendations = {
        'wheat': 'Use NPK 20-20-20 for optimal growth',
        'cotton': 'Use Potassium-based fertilizer with NPK 17-17-17',
        'rice': 'Use Nitrogen-based fertilizer with NPK 20-10-10'
        // ... more crops
    };
    return recommendations[cropType.toLowerCase()] || "General-purpose fertilizer recommended";
}
```
